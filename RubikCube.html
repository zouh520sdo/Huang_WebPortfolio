        <h1>Rubik's Cube Simulation (ongoing)- Huang Zou's Portfolio</h1>
        <h2 class="subtitle"> Introduction </h2>
        <h3 class="content"> I want to use WebGL and JavaScript to create a simulator of 3 by 3 Rubik’s cube. The program would be able to rotate Rubik's cube like what actual cube does, generate a random distributed cube, and determine whether the cube is recovered or not. This project is only for this ECSE-4750 (Computer Graphics), and will be built on top of WebGL code we had in class.</h3>
        
        <h3 class="content"><a href="https://zouh520sdo.github.io/RubikCube/" target="_blank">View on Webpage</a></h3>
        
        <h2 class="subtitle">Progress -- 11/15/2017 </h2>
        <h3 class="content">I wrote a code that can generate 27 small cubes as showed in screenshot. More specifically, I wrote a class for small cube so that I can individually keep track of specific small cube’s position, color, and so on. I also wrote a rough pipeline for rendering 27 small cubes’ positions and colors, camera’s position and projection.</h3>

        <h2 class="subtitle">Progress -- 11/19/2017 </h2>
        <h3 class="content">Continues work from last report, I change the camera view from orthographic view to perspective view, and Color small cubes in proper way. Also, enable rotation on view by holding mouse and drag.</h3>
